## About cookies

A cookie is a file stored on your device that contains an identifier (usually a string of letters and numbers) when you access a website. When you visit the same website again, the cookies stored on your device are accessed by code on the website. This means that the website can recognise the device being used and provide useful features, such as remembering your preferences or keeping you logged in.

Cookies may be either 'persistent cookies' or 'session cookies'. A persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date. A session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.

Cookies that are set by the website owner are called 'first party cookies'. Cookies that are set by another platform or service are called 'third party cookies'. These tend to be used for additional services, such as advertising or analytics.

Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.

We use cookies on this website to help improve the performance of our digital advertising and to collect basic data about how the website is used so that we can make decisions about how to improve it.

## About local storage

Local storage is a type of web storage that allows websites to store data on a user's device. This data is stored in the browser and persists even after the browser is closed. Local storage is often used to store user preferences and settings.

Local storage does not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from local storage.

We use local storage on this website to remember your preferences and settings, such as the framework you’re using for tabs, the language you’re using for code snippets, and the theme you’re using.

## Summary of cookies used by this website

This statement only covers the Design System website at design.sis.gov.uk. This statement does not cover third party websites to which we may link. It does not cover the main SIS website.

## Changes to this notice

We may change this privacy notice. When we make changes to this notice, the 'last updated' date at the bottom of this page will also change. Any changes to this privacy notice will apply to you and your data immediately. If these changes affect how your personal data is processed, SIS will take reasonable steps to make sure you know.
